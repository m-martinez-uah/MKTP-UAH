The entire eastern half of this hill/ridge has been quarried away, leaving a large artificial flat plateau as the tomb's courtyard, sloping downward to the northeast. Question: was the tomb built first before the hill was quarried (in which case a substantial section of the corridor was removed), or was the tomb built secondly, after the hill was quarried? The large-scale excavation of this hillside leaves a clear unobstructed line of sight from the entrance of tt072 (located behind) to the mortuary temple of Tuthmosis III on the plain below. The owner of tt072 (Ra) was high priest of that temple, and if he himself did not cut away the obstructing hillside, then he located his tomb to take advantage of this view, as well as to be near the tomb of his own father, tt121 (Ahmose).","Bibliography":"\"Kampp,TN2,630,631.\nMond,R.ASAE6(1905):73-74.\"","Elevation (MSL)":144.395,"x":460705.595,"y":2846146.706},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[32.608244965171117,25.732752199816442]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"Tomb No.":"k024","Alternate No. 1":null,"Alternate No. 2":null,"Alternate No. 3":null,"Location":"SAQ Upper Enclosure","Occupant":"Unknown","Translit.
